#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the development of software using engineering tools, methods and principles.
Software engineering helps in creating/developing relevant software to meet human needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
First is the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran)
Second is the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
Third is the advent of structured programming in the 1970s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of the software development cycle are Requirement, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment and Maintenanace
-Requirements: This involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements-linux, windows,etc
-Design: This imnvolves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
-Implementation: This is about building the software according to the design specifications. It includes writing codes
-Testing: Here, tests are conducted to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
-Deployment: This is where the software is released to users or customers.
-Maintenance: The work of a software engineer is not over after deployment. This phase involves providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
CONTRAST
Waterfall has a Sequential approach; Agile has Iterative and Incremental approach.
Waterfall uses extensive, upfront documentation	while Agile uses lightweight and adaptive documentation.
In terms of flexibility, Waterfall is rigid once development begins while Agile is highly adaptable.
Waterfall can be used in government projects requiring extensive documentation and adherence to strict regulations; Agile can be used in projects where requirements evolve rapidly, and continuous customer feedback is crucial.
SIMILARITIES
Both methodologies are designed to help manage and organize projects efficiently, ensuring that objectives are met.
Both involve dividing the project into phases or steps. In Waterfall, the phases are sequential (requirement gathering, design, development, testing, etc.), while in Agile, they are iterative (sprints).
Both methodologies rely on clearly defined roles (project manager, developers, testers, etc.) to ensure smooth operations and accountability.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
-Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
-Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
-Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
-System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
-Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Testing helps in the systematic process of ensuring that software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts to guide AI models, like GPT, to produce desired responses. 
Prompt engineering helps to ask clear and specific questions , so the AI understands exactly what you need."


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Short, General Prompts: “Explain gravity.” (Produces a broad overview).
Detailed, Specific Prompts: “Explain gravity in the context of Einstein’s theory of relativity and its impact on modern physics.” (Produces a focused, detailed answer).
